# 🎮Simon Game

This is a very simple implementation of the classic **Simon Game**.  
The main goal is to **repeat the color sequence** for as long as you can without making a mistake.

## 🧠 How it works

- The game shows a sequence of colors (one by one).
- Your task is to **repeat the exact sequence** by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
- Each round adds one more color to the sequence.
- The game continues until you press the wrong color.

## 💻 Technologies used

- **JavaScript** – handles the game logic and interactivity
- **CSS** – used for basic styling and animations

## 🚀 How to run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start playing by pressing any key (or depending on your implementation, clicking a Start button).

## 🎯 Objective

Try to get the **highest possible score** by following the color patterns as long as you can!
